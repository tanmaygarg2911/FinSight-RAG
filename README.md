**🔴 Version 1 (Failed Attempt) - FinSight-RAG**  
This is my first attempt at building a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) QA bot** for **Profit & Loss (P&L) statements**.  

💡 **Why it Failed?**  
- ❌ **Data Extraction Issues** – Extracted tables and text were inconsistent.  
- ❌ **Querying Issues** – Results lacked relevance and accuracy.  
- ❌ **Embeddings & Retrieval** – ChromaDB indexing was ineffective for meaningful responses.  

🔍 **Files in v1:**  
- **backend.py** – PDF parsing, table extraction, vector embedding, and querying.  
- **frontend.py** – Streamlit-based UI for file upload and querying.
